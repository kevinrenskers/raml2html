# RAML to HTML

A simple RAML to HTML documentation generator, written for Node.js.


## Install
```
npm i -g raml2html
```


## Usage
As a command line script:

```
raml2html example.raml > example.html
raml2html -i example.raml -o example.html
```

As a library:

```
var raml2html = require('raml2html');

// Using the default templates:
// source can either be a filename, file contents (string) or parsed RAML object
raml2html.parse(source, onSuccess, onError);

// Using your own templates:
// - config should be an object with at least an `template` property
// - config can also include `helpers` and `partials`
// - the config object will be accessible from your handlebars templates
raml2html.parseWithConfig(source, config, onSuccess, onError);
```

### Gulp
There's a Gulp plugin at https://www.npmjs.org/package/gulp-raml2html.

## To do
This project is still a work in progress, but the output is very usable already (and is in fact used by multiple 
companies including Google). Still left to do, in no particular order:

* Template options (for example to turn off side bar navigation)
* Finish HTML output, currently there's still some stuff missing (like securedBy)
