# RAML to HTML

A simple RAML to HTML parser written for Node.js.


## Install
```
npm i -g raml2html
```


## Usage
```
raml2html --raml example.raml -o example.html
```

## To do
This project is still very much a work in progress, but the output is quite useable already.

* Template options (for example to turn off side bar navigation)
* Finish HTML output, currently there's still a lot missing (like headers) and a bit messy (need to hide empty tabs)
* Different templates (for example render to Markdown to create awesome README's)
